# Executive Dashboard 
## Overview 
This dashboard is designed to track and analyze food recovery and distribution efforts across multiple community health programs. It provides actionable insights into program performance, resource allocation, and community impact. 
One key purpose of tracking these metrics is to report outcomes for grant funding, enabling us to secure additional resources and direct more funds to high-need community areas. 
This dashboard supports initiatives such as: 
- **Produce Recovery Project:** Monitoring recovered produce and its allocation (donations vs. compost).
- **Food Distribution Programs:** Tracking pounds of food distributed by year, program, and partner organizations.
- **Community Impact:** Measuring the number of people served across programs.
- ## Why This Matters
- **Grant Reporting:** Demonstrating program success to funders.
- **Resource Allocation:** Prioritizing high-need communities.
- **Program Growth:** Securing additional funding to expand services.
- ## Features -
- **Year-over-Year Analysis:** Compare food recovery and distribution trends over time.
- **Program-Level Insights:** View contributions and impact by individual programs.
- **Organizational Breakdown:** Assess food distribution by partner organizations.
- **Visual Summaries:** Interactive charts and graphs for quick decision-making.
